# Project Summary
I developed this project as part of my Certificate IV in Web Development at TAFE SA, using JavaScript Regular Expression.

**The major requirements for this project included:**

- Utilizing a CSS framework to style the form (I opted for Bootstrap).
- Implementing JavaScript Regular Expression to validate input data.
- Integrating [FormToEmail](https://formtoemail.com/) for email notification upon form submission.
