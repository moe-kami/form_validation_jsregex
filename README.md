# Summary
I developed this project as part of my Certificate IV in Web Development at TAFE SA, using JavaScript Regular Expression.


The major requirements included:

- Utilizing a CSS framework to style the form (I opted for Bootstrap).
- Implementing JavaScript RegEx to validate input data.
- Integrating FormToEmail (https://formtoemail.com/) for email notification upon form submission.
